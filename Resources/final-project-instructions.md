# Final Project Instructions

## Final Project Presentation Instructions

 - Make a four-minute video, (i.e., time > 3:59 and time < 5:00) and upload it to us.tv or bittube.video by December 9th.
 - Try for one slide (or Jupyter screenfull) per minute: thus, four slides. 
 - Post a link to the course chat, in a new thread in the channel #Final Project Presentations channel. Make the title of your thread the title of your final project.
 - Watch and respond to at least three other presentations. 
   - This is part of your presentation grade.
   - Write thoughtful responses. It's good to mention some things that are working well, along with some constructive criticism for how it might be improved.

## Final Project Notebook Instructions

 - Final projects will be due on December 16th, at 13:00 EST.
 - Like the homework, it should be a single Jupyter notebook. 
 - Send it via email, to jonathan.reeve@columbia.edu.
 - Word count: 1,500â€“2,500 words of Markdown prose.
   - I'll post a script that can help you count
 - You're limited to a maximum of **3 figures/charts/visualizations**
   - This means, be selective about what you choose to visualize.
   - Subfigures are OK.
 - Format: Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file, as with the homework. 
   - I'll provide a template.
   - Make it pretty! 
     - Don't print out too much. If you have a code cell that prints out the text of an entire novel, this will make your notebook very hard to read.
   - Make it repeatable. (At least on your own machine. Run `Restart and Run All Cells` to verify that it works in sequence.)
 - Write good markdown.
   - Ex: 'in the story "The Garden Party," by Katherine Mansfield' 
     - quotation marks for the titles of stories
   - Ex: 'in the book _The Garden Party and Other Stories_' 
     - italics for the titles of books
   - Don't use **emphasis formatting** if you can avoid it. Instead, emphasize things with your words.
   - It's better to write transition sentences to lead your reader to a new section, rather than subdivide your paper into too many sections using headings and subheadings. 
 - Write good code. 
   - DRY: don't repeat yourself
   - Document what you're doing with code comments and markdown cells. 
     - Code comments (lines beginning with `#` in Python) should usually reflect **why** you are writing what you're writing, rather than *what* you're writing. 
   - Functions are good! Use them everywhere.
   - Again, run all your cells to show your output.
   - Revise your code so that it's cleaner, nicer, and better documented. 
 - Research is good.
   - The best final projects are usually in dialogue with some literary critical argument(s).
   - JSTOR and Google Scholar are good starting-points for finding literary critical articles that discuss your text(s). 
 - Use MLA format for citations.
   - Ex: "diamonds are forever" (Bond 132). 
   - Don't use parenthetical citations if it's obvious whom you're citing
   - Make a bibliography at the end called "Works Cited" listing all of the critical works you quote or reference. Make it the final cell in your notebook. 
   - Refer to [style.mla.org](https://style.mla.org/) for more details on MLA style. 
 - Start with a prose introduction. 
   - Say what your problem is. What questions are you trying to answer? 
 - Show all your code.
 - End with a conclusion. 
 - Failure can sometimes be interesting! 
   - Don't be afraid to show unexpected results, or analyses that didn't work the way you'd expected.
 - *Focus.* 
   - Show that you're intimately familiar with the text(s), and that you're deeply focused on one aspect of them. 
   - Avoid the machine-gun approach of trying lots of analytic techniques.
   - Less is more. It's better to do fewer types of analyses, but to do them well, and to discuss them well.
   
## Next Steps: **Optional**

 - You can get a small bonus of 5% on your final project, by making it public to the world. 
   - Make it a GitHub Gist or repository. 
   - Post the link to Zulip.
   - Add a link to your gist to the course repository.
 - Make a blog post about it? 
 - Tweet about it? 
 - Submit it to a conference? Like [DH2021](https://dh2021.adho.org/)
 - Submit it to a journal? Like [The Journal of Cultural Analytics](https://culturalanalytics.org/) 
   - Or [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh)
   - Respond to an existing paper?
